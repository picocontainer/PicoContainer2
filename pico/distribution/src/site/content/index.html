<h2>What is PicoContainer?</h2>

<p>PicoContainer is a  highly embeddable full service Inversion of Control (IoC) container
for components honour the Dependency Injection pattern.</p>
<p>You could use it as a lightweight alternative to Sun's J2EE patterns for web applications or general solutions. </p>
<p>What is Dependency Injection? Martin Fowler has a good <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">article</a> from 2003, but here is another view: It is a good design pattern that, for large enterprise applications, facilitates: </p>
<ul>
  <li>easy best practice  unit testing vs little and difficult unit testing. </li>
  <li>component reuse vs  rewriting through ignorance or need </li>
  <li>centralized configuration vs components reading their own config (scattered) </li>
  <li>clean &amp; declarative architecture vs nest of singletons that nobody can make sense of </li>
  <li>maintainability vs developers having difficulties fixing bugs </li>
  <li>adaptability vs developers not knowing where to start to add features</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependency Injection is
  quite often, but not exclusively, used by Agile practicioners. It
  counters the situation where the enterprise application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>has grown to be thousands of classes, with dozens if not
  hundreds of Singletons</li>
  <li>draws similarities to Spaghetti, Hairballs or <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">Balls of Mud</a></li>
  <li>has made development staff looking after it miserable</li>
  <li>suffers repeated allegations of being unable to be developed without complete rewrite </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite it being very compact in size (the core is ~128K and it
has no mandatory dependencies outside the JDK), PicoContainer supports different dependency injection types (Constructor, Setter, Annotated Field and Method) and offers multiple lifecycle and monitoring strategies.</p>
<p>PicoContainer has originally been implemented in Java but is also
available for other platforms and languages. These are detailed <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/PICO/Ports">here</a>.</p>
