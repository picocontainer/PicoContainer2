    <title>Properties</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>DefaultPicoContainer allows for some properties to be set
   per component at the time each is added. There is a convenience class on
   which supplied properties are specified. It is called
   Characteristics. You can use them via static imports or long-name
   them.</p>

<p>Properties can be set for a component in a method 'as' on
   MutablePicoContainer. If that is the case then the properties will
   affect the next component added only.</p>

<p>They can also be set in a more persistent manner for the
   MutablePicoContainer in question. If so, they will affect all subsequent
   additions of component.</p>

<p>Some examples :</p>

<div class="source"><pre>
import static org.picocontainer.Characteristics.SDI;
import static org.picocontainer.Characteristics.CACHE;
...
pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.as(CACHE).addComponent(Apple.class);
pico.as(CACHE, SDI).addComponent(Pear.class);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="source"><pre>import static org.picocontainer.Characteristics.SDI;
import static org.picocontainer.Characteristics.CACHE;
...
pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.change(CACHE).addComponent(Apple.class);
pico.change(SDI).addComponent(Pear.class);</pre>
</div>
<div class="source"><pre>
pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.as(Characteristics.CACHE).addComponent(Apple.class);
pico.as(Characteristics.CACHE,
    Characteristics.SDI).addComponent(Pear.class);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="source"><pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.change(Characteristics.CACHE).addComponent(Apple.class);
pico.change(Characteristics.SDI).addComponent(Pear.class);</pre>
</div>

<p>Some characteristics are mutually exclusive. For example CDI,
   SDI. Meaning the last one set via 'as' or 'change' rules. Others are
   additive like CACHE and HIDE_IMPL. The order of these is not important. </p>

<h3>Appropriate Behavior and Injection Factories.</h3>

<p>Every characteristics set for a component must be handled by a
   BehaviorFactory or InjectionFactory that recognises it. They are
   typically chained together. DefaultPicoContainer's default
   BehaviorFactory and InjectionFactory are AdaptiveBehaviorFactory and
   AdaptiveInjectionFactory. These can handle CDI and SDI as well as CACHE
   and HIDE_IMPL.</p>

<p>If you setup DefaultPicoContainer with a
   BehaviorFactory/InjectionFactory combination that is unaware of the
   characteristics you subsequently use, Pico will object by way of an
   exception as you add the component to the container. See <a href="unprocessed-properties-help.html">Unprocessed Properties</a>. </p>
   
<h3>Custom Properties</h3>
<p>You can make your own properties quite easily - check out the source to <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/picocontainer/java/2.x/trunk/pico/container/src/java/org/picocontainer/Characteristics.java">Characteristics.java</a>. Each will need to have a ComponentFactory that can process it. </p>
