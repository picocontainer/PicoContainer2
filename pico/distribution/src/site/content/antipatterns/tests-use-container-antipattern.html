    <title>Tests Use Container</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>

    <p> A class is directly instantiating a PicoContainer and registering components within it. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Causes</h2>

<p>This smell is most often found in unit tests. It could be as a
result of Container Dependency. The container is supplied to the class
being tested, which then uses it to locate its dependencies.</p>

<p>Another cause is using the container to build the object we are testing, which itself may have several
       dependencies. For example::</p>

    <div class="source">
        <div>
            <pre>public void testCocktailWithVodkaIsAlcoholic() {
    DefaultPicoContainer container = new DefaultPicoContainer();
    container.addComponent(Banana.class);
    container.addComponent(Vanilla.class);
    container.addComponent(Vodka.class);
    container.addComponent(Cocktail.class);

    Cocktail cocktail = (Cocktail) container.getComponent(Cocktail.class);

    assertTrue(cocktail.isAlcoholic());
}</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>What To Do</h2>

<p>For unit tests like this, the class being tested should be
instantiated directly by the test. <a href="mock-objects.html"
  title="Mock Objects">Mock Objects</a> should be used to
&quot;mock&quot; the dependent objects, i.e. supplying a fake
implementation that can have expectations set and verified on it, rather
than a real implementataion. So, the test becomes:</p>

<div class="source">
        <div>
            <pre>public void testCocktailWithVodkaIsAlcoholic() {

    Banana banana = createMockBanana();
    Vanilla vanilla = createMockVanilla();
    Vodka vodka = createMockVodka();

    // set expectations on banana, vanilla and vodka here.

    Cocktail cocktail = new Cocktail(banana, vanilla, vodka);
    assertTrue(cocktail.isAlcoholic());

    // verify expectations on banana, vanilla and vodka here.
}</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>The implementation details of creating a mock object and setting and verifying expectations have been left out of
       the example, as the details depend on which mock object library/technique is used.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Exceptions</h2>

    <p>The container has to be instantiated somewhere!</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Bootstrappers
        </h3>

        <p>A common place to instantiate containers is in some bootstrap class in the application.</p>

        <div class="section_1">
            <h1>Functional
                                                                                                                 Tests
            </h1>

            <p>There may be a requirement to write a high-level &quot;functional&quot; test, in which you wish to test
               the interactions between a set of real components (not mocks). In this case, you may wish to create a
               container with the appropriate components registered for your test.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>NanoContainer
                </h3>

                <p>If you are using <a href="http://www.nanocontainer.org" title="Sister Projects">NanoContainer</a>,
                   you can use NanoContainer's Standalone class (a bootstrapper) to start the application. All the
                   container configuration can live in a script and NanoContainer (and thereby PicoContainer(s)) will be
                   instantiated.</p>
