<h2>Web Containers / Web Frameworks</h2>
<p>There are only about a million for the Java servlet container. There more recent and sophisticated ones try to do Dependency Injection for 'actions' or 'controllers'. If you want to use PicoContainer for a web framework, then you're likely to end up with three container levels. The root container would be common to all and known as the application-level container. One level further would be a session-level one, with the app one marked as its parent. One level further would be a request level one, with the session on marked as its parent. There are two not so subtle varations on how they would be used. One, we poineered with PicoContainer 1.x in 2003, the other inroduced with PicoContainer 2.x in 2007.</p>
<h3>PicoContainer and web frameworks - the old way.</h3>
<p>You make one instance of the app container. For each new HTTP Session you make a new session level container, and put it into the session itself - refer HttpSession.setAttribute(key,val). For each request, you make a new Request level container and discard it at the end of the request. For as long as it lives, the request level container's parent would be the session container.</p>
<p>There are two downsides of this approach. 1) you have to repeatedly add components to the session and request containers as they are instantiated. 2) the serialization of the session (by Tomcat etc) might cause more things to be serialized than you intend - i.e. the session container refers to the application container.</p>
<h3>PicoContainer and web frameworks - the new way.</h3>
<p>You make one instance of the app, session and request container on servlet load. For the Application one, you choose Caching as the behavior factory. For the session and request level ones, you choose Storing instead. You wrap the Storing behavior factory instances in HttpSessionStoring and reprogram each http request like so:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>
public class MyTinyPicoServlet extends HttpServlet {

    private DefaultPicoContainer requestContainer;

    private HttpSessionStoring sessionStoring;
    private HttpSessionStoring requestStoring;

    public void init(ServletConfig cfg) throws ServletException {

        PicoContainer appContainer = new DefaultPicoContainer(new Caching());

        Storing sessionStoreBehavior = new Storing();

        PicoContainer sessionContainer = new DefaultPicoContainer(sessionStoreBehavior, appContainer);

        sessionStoring = new HttpSessionStoring(sessionStoreBehavior, &quot;sessionStore&quot;);

        Storing requestStoreBehavior = new Storing();
        requestContainer = new DefaultPicoContainer(requestStoreBehavior, sessionContainer);
        requestStoring = new HttpSessionStoring(requestStoreBehavior, &quot;requestStore&quot;);

        // populate app, session and request scoped containers.
        // appContainer.addComponent(HibernateManager.class, MyHibernateManager.class); // all users/people share one HibernateManager
        // sessionContainer.addComponent(ShoppingCart.class, FifoCart.class); // a new cart per person
        // requestContainer.addComponent(&quot;/addToCart.do&quot;, AddToCart.class);
        // requestContainer.addComponent(&quot;/removeFromCart.do&quot;, RemoveFromCart.class);
        // etc

    }

    protected void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
        throws ServletException, IOException {

        sessionStoring.retrieveSessionStoreOrCreateNewOne(req.getSession());
        requestStoring.resetStore();

        Action action = (Action) requestContainer.getComponent(req.getPathTranslated());

        action.execute(req, resp); // yeah yeah, this is pretty basic

        sessionStoring.invalidateStore();
        requestStoring.invalidateStore();
        // trying to retrieve components from at session or request scopes from here on will result in an UnsupportedOperationException
    }

}
</pre>
</div>
<p>HttpSessionStoring is not in the core jar, its in the 'gems' one.</p>
